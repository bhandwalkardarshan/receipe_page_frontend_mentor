To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``````css
 @font-face {
        font-family: YoungSerif;
        src: url('./assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf');
        font-weight: 400;
    }

    @font-face {
        font-family: Outfit;
        src: url('./assets/fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
    }

    :root {
      /* Primary Colors */
      --nutmeg: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
      --dark-raspberry: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
      
      /* Neutral Colors */
      --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      --rose-white: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
      --eggshell: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);

    }

```

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14676613/how-to-import-google-web-font-in-css-file) - This helped me for importing fonts in css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand responsive designs. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
